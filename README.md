Q: "Why is this project no longer open source?"
A: I've decided to make the RoseGoldAddons closed source due to the rampant amount of people who would fork it, and add a token logger or sometimes even worse.
I try my best to report every single RoseGoldAddons impersonation I can find but unfortunately not all my reports go through. Please only share this mod using this github page, the discord link or https://cheatersgetbanned.me/other-mods/. Thank you.
